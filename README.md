# vtk-to-stl
This primitive utility is based on the VTK library from the libvtk9-dev package. It can convert an isosurface to a continuous polygonal mesh, and optionally apply Gaussian blur to the scalar field before clipping.

Should work with VTK files generated by the [BESO](https://github.com/calculix/beso) script written by [fandaL](https://github.com/fandaL)
The clipping threshold is an option, default value is 0.5

The blur can also be adjusted.

The resolution can also be adjusted.

# How to use
Default usecase:
`$ ./vtk-to-stl file1234.vtk file1234.stl`

Optional usecase:
`$ ./vtk-to-stl file1234.vtk file1234.stl [threshold] [resolution] [gauss_radius] [gauss_deviation]`

Example without blur:
`$ ./vtk-to-stl file1234.vtk file1234.stl 0.25 64`

Example with blur:
`$ ./vtk-to-stl file1234.vtk file1234.stl 0.25 64 2 2`
