# vtk-to-stl
This primitive utility is based on the VTK library from the libvtk9-dev package. It can convert an isosurface to a continuous polygonal mesh, and optionally apply Gaussian blur to the scalar field before clipping.

Should work with VTK files generated by the [BESO](https://github.com/calculix/beso) script written by [fandaL](https://github.com/fandaL).

The clipping threshold is an optional parameter, default value is 0.5

The blur intensity can also be adjusted.

The resolution can also be adjusted.

Symmetry along the selected plane can be enforced.

# How to use
Default usecase:

```$ ./vtk-to-stl file1234.vtk file1234.stl```

Optional usecase:

```$ ./vtk-to-stl file1234.vtk file1234.stl [threshold] [resolution] [gauss_radius] [gauss_deviation] [symmetry]```

Example without blur:

```$ ./vtk-to-stl file1234.vtk file1234.stl 0.35 64```

Example with blur:

```$ ./vtk-to-stl file1234.vtk file1234.stl 0.25 64 4 2```

Example with blur and symmetry along the X-plane:

```$ ./vtk-to-stl file1234.vtk file1234.stl 0.1 128 3 2 x```

Example with blur and symmetry along both the X-plane and Y-plane:

```$ ./vtk-to-stl file1234.vtk file1234.stl 0.1 128 3 2 xy```

Example with symmetry along all planes:

```$ ./vtk-to-stl file1234.vtk file1234.stl 0.1 128 0 0 xyz```
